# The rules for Roman numerals are as follows:
# 
# The basic symbols are I (= 1), V (= 5), X (= 10), L (= 50), C (= 100), D (= 500), and M (= 1000).
# 
# If a letter is immediately followed by one of equal or lesser value, 
#   the two numbers are added; thus, XX = 20, XV = 15, VI = 6.
# 
# Some other examples of roman numerals are:
# 8 = VIII
# 2021 = MMXXI current year
